# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices for the `codeguide-starter-fullstack` project in everyday language. Each section describes why we picked certain tools and how they work together to build a solid foundation for your web application.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

We use modern tools to build a fast, interactive user interface that’s easy to maintain:

- **Next.js (React Framework)**
  - Provides file-based routing: your folders and files under `app/` automatically become pages and API endpoints.
  - Supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box, improving load times and SEO.
- **React 18**
  - Lets us build UI as reusable components that update smoothly when data changes.
- **TypeScript**
  - Adds type safety (checks for mistakes before you even run the code), making the codebase more reliable and easier to understand.
- **CSS (globals.css & theme.css)**
  - `globals.css` sets site-wide styles (colors, fonts, spacing).
  - `theme.css` defines color palettes and design tokens so you can change the look in one place.
- **ESLint & Prettier**
  - Enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early in development.

How these choices enhance the user experience:

- Fast initial load through SSR/SSG in Next.js.
- Component-based React keeps UI consistent and makes changes predictable.
- TypeScript helps avoid common mistakes, so features work as expected.
- Centralized styling files ensure a uniform look and make theme updates simple.

## 2. Backend Technologies

Our backend is lightweight and lives in the same project, handling data and authentication:

- **Next.js API Routes (`app/api/auth/route.ts`)**
  - Let you create server-side endpoints (sign-up, sign-in) without a separate server.
  - Keep frontend and backend logic together for faster iteration.
- **Node.js (v16+)**
  - Runs JavaScript on the server side. It’s fast, widely supported, and works seamlessly with Next.js.
- **Local JSON Data (`data.json`)**
  - Acts as a mock database during development.
  - Lets you prototype UI and data views quickly without setting up a real database.

How these pieces work together:

1. A user submits credentials on the sign-in/sign-up page.  
2. The form sends a request to an API route in the same codebase.  
3. The API route processes the data (e.g., validate email, hash password).  
4. On success, the route responds, and Next.js redirects the user to the dashboard.  
5. The dashboard page reads from `data.json` to display sample content.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

To keep deployments simple, reliable, and scalable, we recommend:

- **Version Control: Git & GitHub**
  - Store and track all code changes in Git.
  - Collaborate easily through pull requests on GitHub.
- **Hosting Platform: Vercel**
  - First-class support for Next.js applications.
  - Automatic deployments when you push to the main branch.
  - Free SSL certificates and global CDN for fast page loads.
- **CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions**
  - Automatically run linting and tests on every pull request.
  - Deploy to Vercel (or another cloud) after checks pass.

How these decisions help:

- **Reliability:** Automated checks catch errors before they reach production.
- **Scalability:** Vercel’s CDN scales your app globally without extra setup.
- **Ease of Deployment:** Push to GitHub, and your app goes live—no manual steps needed.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

In this starter kit, we keep integrations minimal to stay focused on core features:

- **None by default**
  - No external APIs or services are tied in at this stage.

Future integrations might include:

- **Authentication Providers** (Google, GitHub)  
  - Let users sign in with existing accounts.
- **Analytics Tools** (Google Analytics, Plausible)  
  - Track user behavior and measure performance.
- **Payment Processors** (Stripe)  
  - Handle subscriptions or one-time payments.

Adding these later is straightforward once the foundation is in place.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve built in basic safeguards and performance steps to keep users safe and happy:

- **Security Measures:**
  - **Password Handling:** Hash passwords (e.g., via `bcrypt`) before storing them (even in a mock scenario).
  - **Secure Cookies:** Store sessions in HTTP-only cookies to prevent JavaScript access.
  - **Input Validation:** Check user input on both client and server to avoid bad data.
  - **Redirect Protection:** Unauthenticated users get sent back to the sign-in page if they try to access `/dashboard`.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js pre-renders pages for faster first load.
  - **Static Assets on CDN:** All CSS and images served from a content delivery network.
  - **Code Splitting:** Only load the JavaScript needed for each page, keeping initial downloads small.

These practices ensure a smooth, secure experience for end users.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

To recap, here’s why each major technology was chosen and how it aligns with our goals:

- **Next.js + React + TypeScript**: Fast, SEO-friendly pages with type safety and component reusability.
- **API Routes & Node.js**: Simple, serverless backend logic lives in the same codebase for quick iteration.
- **CSS Styling**: Clear separation of global styles and theme variables makes design changes easy.
- **Git + GitHub + Vercel + GitHub Actions**: A streamlined workflow from code changes to production deployment.

This combination delivers:

- A **robust starter** that handles authentication, routing, and layouts right away.
- A **friendly developer experience**: clone the repo, install dependencies, and see a working app in minutes.
- A **scalable platform**: ready to add real databases, third-party services, and advanced features as your project grows.

With this tech stack, teams can focus on building features instead of wrestling with configuration. You have everything you need to start a modern full-stack web application with confidence.
