# Backend Structure Document

This document explains how the backend of the `codeguide-starter-fullstack` project is organized, hosted, and maintained. It’s written in plain language so anyone can understand how the pieces fit together and why they were chosen.

## 1. Backend Architecture

### Overall Design
- We use Next.js’s built-in API Routes to handle server-side work. Each file under `app/api/` becomes a serverless function.  
- The backend lives in the same codebase as the frontend, sharing TypeScript types and folder structure.  
- File-based routing means the folder structure directly maps to URL paths, so there’s no separate routing config.

### Frameworks and Patterns
- **Next.js API Routes**: Server‐side endpoints written in TypeScript.  
- **Node.js**: Under the hood, those API routes run on a Node.js environment (v16+).  
- **Component-Driven**: Business logic is split into small functions that can be re-used by different routes.

### Scalability, Maintainability, Performance
- **Scalability**: Serverless functions auto-scale with demand—no need to manage servers.  
- **Maintainability**: Keeping backend code next to frontend code simplifies sharing types and utilities.  
- **Performance**: Next.js pre-optimizes routes and cold starts are minimized on platforms like Vercel.

## 2. Database Management

### Current Setup (Mock Data)
- We use a local JSON file (`data.json`) as a stand-in for a real database during development.  
- This file lives in the repo and contains an array of objects representing dashboard items.

### Future Database Options
- When migrating to a real database, you could choose:
  - **SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)** for structured, relational data.  
  - **NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)** for flexible, document-oriented storage.

### Data Access
- In the mock version, API routes read `data.json` directly.  
- In a real setup, you’d replace that read with a database query using an ORM like Prisma or a driver like `pg`.

## 3. Database Schema

### Mock Data (`data.json`)
The JSON file holds an array of dashboard items. Each item has:
- **id** (string): Unique identifier.  
- **title** (string): Name of the item or metric.  
- **value** (number): Numeric data to display.  
- **details** (string): Optional description or extra info.

Example in everyday terms:
- Item 1: id = "item1", title = "Total Users", value = 1024, details = "Count of all registered users"  
- Item 2: id = "item2", title = "Active Sessions", value = 87, details = "Users currently online"

### (Future) SQL Schema Example
If you switch to PostgreSQL, your `dashboard_items` table might look like:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dashboard_items (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  value INTEGER NOT NULL,
  details TEXT
);
```

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

We follow a simple RESTful style using Next.js API Routes.

### Key Endpoints
- **POST /api/auth**  
  - Purpose: Sign up or sign in a user.  
  - Input: `{ email: string, password: string }`  
  - Output: Success status, user session or error message.

- **GET /api/data** (optional)  
  - Purpose: Fetch mock dashboard items from `data.json`.  
  - Output: Array of items.

### How Frontend Calls These
1. Sign-in form submits credentials to `/api/auth`.  
2. On success, Next.js sets a session cookie and redirects to `/dashboard`.  
3. Dashboard page fetches `/api/data` to display items.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

### Chosen Platform: Vercel
- **Why Vercel?**  
  - Built by the creators of Next.js—seamless integration.  
  - Automatic global CDN for static assets.  
  - Serverless functions run our API Routes without setup.

### Benefits
- **Reliability**: Automatic health checks and rollbacks.  
- **Scalability**: Instantly scales serverless functions with traffic.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Free tier available; pay only for extra usage.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

### Load Balancing and CDN
- Vercel uses its edge network to distribute traffic across regions.  
- Static files (CSS, images) served from a CDN close to users.

### Caching Mechanisms
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** in Next.js can cache pages and update them in the background.  
- **HTTP Caching** headers can be configured for API responses.

### Content Delivery Networks
- All static assets are automatically uploaded and distributed by Vercel’s CDN.

## 7. Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Secure Cookies**: Session tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent JavaScript access.  
- **Password Handling**: Even in mock mode, follow best practice by hashing passwords with a library like `bcrypt`.

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Check and sanitize all incoming data on the server.  
- **Redirect Protection**: Unauthenticated users are sent back to `/sign-in` if they try to access protected routes.

### Compliance and Best Practices
- Plan for GDPR by ensuring user data can be erased or exported upon request.  
- Prepare to add CSRF tokens if you introduce cookie-based sessions in production.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in metrics for response times, cold starts, and bandwidth.  
- **Optional Tools**: Integrate Sentry or Datadog to track errors and performance events in more detail.

### Logging
- Use `console.log` in development; in production, route logs to a service like Logflare or Datadog.

### Maintenance Strategies
- **Automated Tests**: Run linting and basic API tests via GitHub Actions on every pull request.  
- **Dependency Updates**: Schedule regular checks (Dependabot) and use `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities.  
- **Backups**: If you adopt a real database, set up automated backups (e.g., daily snapshots on PostgreSQL).

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

This backend uses Next.js API Routes and a local JSON file as a quick, zero-config starting point. It lives next to the frontend for shared types and easy deployment. Hosted on Vercel, it scales seamlessly without manual server management. Key highlights:

- **Serverless Architecture**: No servers to maintain—functions scale automatically.  
- **Local Mock Database**: Simplifies development; ready to swap to SQL or NoSQL.  
- **Secure by Default**: HTTP-only cookies and input checks protect user data.  
- **Easy Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics plus optional Sentry/Datadog integrations.

As your project grows, you can replace the mock data with a real database, integrate third-party services, and expand the API surface—all without changing the underlying structure. This setup gives you a clear path from prototype to production.
