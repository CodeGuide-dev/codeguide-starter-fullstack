# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new visitor opens the application in a browser, they arrive at the root URL, where the global layout displays the site name and navigation links labeled “Sign In” and “Sign Up.” Clicking “Sign Up” takes the user to the sign-up page. A simple form appears asking for an email address and a password. When the user fills in these fields and submits the form, the application sends the information to the authentication endpoint at `/api/auth/route`. If everything is valid, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard. If there is an error, an inline message appears above the form explaining what went wrong, and the user can correct the input.

Returning visitors click “Sign In” in the navigation. They are taken to a page with a login form that again asks for email and password. After entering credentials and submitting, the application sends a POST request to the same `/api/auth/route` endpoint. On success, the user session is established and the user is sent to the main dashboard. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message appears and the user stays on the sign-in page until valid details are entered. There is no separate forgot password flow in the current version, so users must contact support or retry with known credentials. Signing out is available after login through a link labeled “Sign Out” in the header, which clears the session and returns the user to the sign-in page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once authenticated, the user lands on the dashboard at `/dashboard`. The global layout still wraps the view, providing the site header and the “Sign Out” link, and the dashboard layout adds a sidebar or top navigation bar specific to the dashboard. This dashboard interface shows data pulled from a local `data.json` file, such as lists of items or summary metrics. The header area may display the user’s email or name. From this main view, the user can click any sidebar label or header link to navigate to other parts of the dashboard or return to the sign-in or sign-up pages if they have been logged out.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user chooses to sign up, the page transition goes from the root layout to the sign-up page. The sign-up form collects the user’s email and password and then calls the API to create a new account. After a successful response, the application programmatically navigates to the dashboard route. If the user instead goes to sign in, the transition is the same but the form action is interpreted as authentication rather than account creation. Once the user is on the dashboard, clicking the site logo or a “Home” link in the dashboard navigation returns them to the dashboard main view. Attempting to access `/dashboard` directly in the URL bar while not signed in triggers a redirect back to `/sign-in`, enforcing protection.

On the dashboard itself, any link or button that takes the user outside of this section is handled by the root layout, which may navigate back to the sign-in or sign-up pages. When the user clicks “Sign Out,” the application calls a sign-out function that clears the session on the client and possibly invalidates a cookie, then routes the user to the sign-in page. Every page transition uses the framework’s file-based routing under the `app` directory, so the URL path always matches the folder and file where the code lives.

## Settings and Account Management

In the current version, there is no dedicated settings or profile page for managing personal details beyond email and password at sign-up. The primary account management action is signing out, which the user finds in the global header. Future versions may include a profile page under `/profile` or `/settings` where users can update their information, configure notification preferences, or manage subscriptions. At present, any change to preferences or account details would require updating code or database records externally, as there is no UI for it.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters invalid data on sign-up or sign-in, the form validation runs on the client and the server. Errors such as missing fields, improperly formatted email, or weak password are caught and displayed above the form. If the network connection fails during an API call, a generic message prompts the user to check their connection and try again. When an unauthenticated user attempts to view a protected page, the application automatically redirects to the sign-in page with no warning popup, preserving security. Unexpected server errors return a generic error view or message, and the user can retry the action or refresh the page to recover.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a new user discovers the application at its root URL, they can create an account or log in with just an email and password. After authentication, they land on a clean dashboard interface that uses mock data to illustrate how real content will appear. Navigation is intuitive through links in the global header and dashboard layout, and signing out is always one click away. Error messages guide the user through any mistakes, and unauthorized access is blocked automatically. In everyday use, the goal is to sign in, review or interact with dashboard data, and sign out when finished, providing a smooth and predictable journey from start to finish.
